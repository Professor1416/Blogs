# Releases with Smart Rollouts

Deploying new code to production can introduce bugs or outages. **Canary deployment** mitigates this risk by rolling out updates to a small subset of users first, so that any problems are caught early. For example, AWS explains that canaries “incrementally deploy the new version” so you gain confidence before replacing the old version entirely. In practice this means only a few users experience the new release initially, while most continue on the stable version. Gradual rollouts like this give teams time to monitor system health and abort if metrics (error rates, response times, etc.) worsen.

## What is a Canary Deployment?

A canary deployment is a **progressive rollout** where traffic is split between the existing (stable) version and a new version. Spinnaker’s documentation explains it as a process “in which a change is partially rolled out, then evaluated against the current deployment (baseline)” using key metrics. In other words, the new release is first sent to a small, controlled group of servers or users. If those canary instances behave well (passing the health checks), the rollout continues; if not, engineers halt or roll back the release. This method is not a replacement for thorough testing, but it provides real-world validation under real traffic.

**Real-World Analogy:** The term “canary” comes from the old practice of taking canary birds into coal mines as an early warning of danger. Similarly, a canary release exposes only a few users to the new software as a kind of early warning system. If the “canary” signals (error spikes, failed requests) appear, the team can pause or reverse the deployment before it affects everyone. This analogy helps visualize the strategy: just as miners use canaries to detect toxic gas, engineers use canary deployments to detect software issues in production safely.

## Deployment Phases: 1%, 10%, 50%, 100%

Canary rollouts are typically broken into phases with increasing traffic to the new version. A common pattern is:

```plaintext
Phase 1 (≈1% of users): Deploy the new release to ~1% of servers or user base. Monitor key
metrics closely (e.g. error rates, latency). Keep this small group isolated or “pinned” so their
sessions always hit the same version.
Phase 2 (≈10% of users): If Phase 1 looks healthy, increase rollout to around 10%. Continue
watching logs and dashboards. This larger sample catches issues that only surface under more
load or diversity.
Phase 3 (≈50% of users): After another successful interval, move to about 50%. At this point
most minor issues should be discovered.
Phase 4 (100% – full rollout): If all the previous phases pass quality checks, switch all traffic to
the new version. The old version can then be retired.
```

Different teams use different increments depending on risk tolerance. For example, some do **1% → 10% → 100%** (a quick “1-10-100” rollout). Others take smaller steps like **10% → 20% → 50% → 100%**. At each phase the deployment can be paused or rolled back if any anomalies are detected.

## Code Examples: Feature Flags and Segmentation

Feature flags (toggles) or user segmentation are common ways to implement canaries in code. For instance, you might enable a new feature only for certain users:

```plaintext
<?php
// Example: PHP pseudocode for a canary feature flag
functionisFeatureEnabled($featureName, $userId) {
// E.g. hash user ID to get percentage
return (crc32($userId) % 100) < 10; // 10% of users
}
```

```plaintext
$userId= $_SESSION['user_id'];
if(isFeatureEnabled('new_dashboard', $userId)) {
// Canary: serve new dashboard
include 'dashboard_v2.php';
} else{
// Serve old version
include 'dashboard_v1.php';
}
?>
```

```plaintext
// Example: JavaScript pseudocode for a canary flag
constuserId = getCurrentUserId();
functionisCanaryUser(userId) {
// 10% of users get the new feature
return(parseInt(userId, 10) % 100) < 10;
}
```

```plaintext
if(isCanaryUser(userId)) {
// Load new feature for canary group
enableNewFeature();
} else{
// Default behavior
disableNewFeature();
}
```

These examples show a very simple segmentation by user ID. In production you’d typically use a flag management system (like LaunchDarkly, Flagger, etc.). [Spot.io](http://Spot.io) notes that marking a new feature behind a flag and exposing it to a “canary” group lets you simply toggle it off if problems arise. This means you often don’t need a full redeploy to rollback – you just turn off the flag.

## Real-World Use Cases

```plaintext
Netflix: Netflix is famous for advanced canary deployments. Their open-source Kayenta tool
(built in partnership with Google) automates canary analysis. In practice, Netflix creates
three sets of instances: production (current version), baseline (a small copy of production), and
canary (new version). The canary cluster gets only a little traffic at first. Kayenta then
compares metrics (errors, latency, etc.) between baseline and canary. If the metrics look fine,
Spinnaker (Netflix’s CD platform) continues rollout; if not, it aborts the canary. This
pipeline gives Netflix engineers confidence that changes are safe before reaching all users.
Google: Google Cloud offers built-in canary strategies (e.g. in Cloud Deploy). Google
collaborated with Netflix on Kayenta, and Google Cloud’s docs describe canaries as splitting
traffic between old and new revisions during a rollout. In practice, Google runs phased
rollouts on Kubernetes or Cloud Run so that only a subset of pods serve the new version initially.
Google’s experience mirrors Netflix’s: monitor and only advance if metrics pass.
Uber: Uber’s “μDeploy” system also relies on canaries. They deploy new versions worldwide in
phases, with automated monitoring at each step. In fact, Uber reports that about 10% of their
weekly deployments are automatically rejected and rolled back during canary checks. The
key is that rollbacks often happen in a small “canary area” of servers: as soon as an anomaly is
detected, μDeploy stops the rollout on a handful of machines to contain the failure. This
approach “keeps unruly additions contained,” preventing a bad deploy from affecting most of
Uber’s fleet. This lets Uber deliver code dozens of times per day with minimal customer
impact.
```

## Best Practices

```plaintext
Automate through CI/CD. Use a solid CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Spinnaker, etc.) to
script your canary rollout steps. Automated scripts ensure consistency, reduce human error,
and allow repeatable rollbacks.
Robust monitoring and alerting. Set up comprehensive observability (metrics, logs, tracing)
before the rollout. Monitor CPU, memory, error rates, response times, business KPIs, etc..
Use dashboards (Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, etc.) and alerts to catch deviations immediately
```

. Without good visibility, you can’t trust your canary test results. **Gradual traffic shifting.** Start with a very small percentage of traffic and increase in defined increments. Pin users to a version (sticky sessions) so no one flips between old/new mid- session. This phased approach helps detect issues early and limits blast radius. Only advance to the next stage (e.g. 10%, then 50%) when predefined success criteria (error thresholds, latency budgets) are met. **Use production-like environments.** Your canary instances should match production in config and data. Ideally use the same build artifacts and environment (containers, configs, DB connections) so tests are realistic. Any differences can invalidate the canary comparison. **Implement feature flags.** Toggle flags give you extra control. As Octopus Deploy notes, flags let you enable/disable features without redeploying. You can combine flags with canaries to do A/B tests or kill a feature instantly. Feature management also lets you roll out features incrementally (e.g. enable for 10% of users).

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

```plaintext
Insufficient monitoring or rollback plan. A major pitfall is lacking solid rollback procedures
and alerts. If you don’t have automatic rollback on failure or can’t detect issues quickly, a
canary won’t save you. Always define what “failure” means (e.g. error rate > 0.5%) and automate
the fallback so you don’t scramble.
```

```
Deploying too broadly, too fast. Don’t start at 50% or skip phases. Launching a canary to too
many users at once defeats the purpose. Begin with just 1–10%, verify safety, then scale up
slowly. Rushing a rollout can expose large user groups to hidden bugs.
Overly complex feature flags. Adding flags is great, but too many can clutter your code. Poor
flag management leads to hard-to-read logic and forgotten flags. Keep flags organized and
remove them once fully rolled out. Otherwise, branching logic can become a maintenance
headache.
Neglecting user segmentation. Choosing the wrong canary group (e.g. all users in one region)
can skew results. Strive for a representative sample : mix different regions, account types, or
device classes. If your canary group isn’t diverse, you might miss issues that appear
elsewhere.
Missing issues that only appear at scale. Canary tests can miss problems that only surface
under full load or at scale. Be aware that performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, or rare edge
cases might only show up at 100% traffic. Complement canaries with stress tests and fallback
plans for these scenarios.
```

## Key Takeaways

```
Canary deployments dramatically reduce risk by testing new releases on a small subset of
traffic before full rollout.
Always monitor key metrics and automate judgment: if the canary’s health dips, rollback
immediately.
Use feature flags and segmentation to control who sees the new code (e.g. percentage of
users or specific cohorts).
Be prepared to rollback cleanly : define triggers in advance and automate the switch back to the
stable version.
With proper observability and automation, canaries let you ship faster with confidence – bugs
are found early, and releases become safer.
