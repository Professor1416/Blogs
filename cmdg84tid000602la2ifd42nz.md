## Creational Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

Definition and purpose: The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

Use cases and examples: Common use cases include configuration settings, logging, and managing connections to a database. For example, a logging class that writes to a file might be implemented as a singleton to ensure that all part.

Here is an example of implementing the Singleton Pattern in PHP for a logging class:

```php
<?php

class Logger
{
    // Hold the class instance.
    private static $instance = null;
    private $logFile;

    // The constructor is private to prevent initiation with outer code.
    private function __construct()
    {
        // Open a log file in append mode.
        $this->logFile = fopen("app.log", "a");
    }

    // The object is created from within the class itself only if the class has no instance.
    public static function getInstance()
    {
        if (self::$instance == null) {
            self::$instance = new Logger();
        }

        return self::$instance;
    }

    // Write a message to the log file.
    public function log($message)
    {
        $timestamp = date("Y-m-d H:i:s");
        fwrite($this->logFile, "[$timestamp] $message" . PHP_EOL);
    }

    // Close the log file when the script ends.
    public function __destruct()
    {
        fclose($this->logFile);
    }
}

// Usage
$logger = Logger::getInstance();
$logger->log("This is a log message.");
```

In this example, the `Logger` class is designed to ensure that only one instance of the class is created. The `getInstance` method checks if an instance already exists; if not, it creates one. The `log` method writes messages to a log file, and the destructor ensures the file is closed when the script ends.

### Factory Pattern

Definition and purpose: The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is used to delegate the responsibility of instantiating objects to subclasses.

Use cases and examples: This pattern is often used in frameworks where the library code needs to create objects of a type that is specified by the client. For example, a GUI framework might use a factory pattern to create different types of buttons depending on the operating system.

Here is an example of implementing the Factory Pattern in PHP for creating different types of buttons in a GUI framework:

```php
<?php

// Define an interface for the Button
interface Button
{
    public function render();
}

// Implement a WindowsButton class
class WindowsButton implements Button
{
    public function render()
    {
        return "Rendering a Windows-style button.";
    }
}

// Implement a MacOSButton class
class MacOSButton implements Button
{
    public function render()
    {
        return "Rendering a MacOS-style button.";
    }
}

// Define the ButtonFactory class
class ButtonFactory
{
    // Factory method to create a button
    public static function createButton($osType)
    {
        switch ($osType) {
            case 'Windows':
                return new WindowsButton();
            case 'MacOS':
                return new MacOSButton();
            default:
                throw new Exception("Unsupported OS type.");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
try {
    $button = ButtonFactory::createButton('Windows');
    echo $button->render(); // Outputs: Rendering a Windows-style button.

    $button = ButtonFactory::createButton('MacOS');
    echo $button->render(); // Outputs: Rendering a MacOS-style button.
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

In this example, the `ButtonFactory` class provides a static method `createButton` that takes an operating system type as a parameter and returns an instance of the appropriate button class. The `WindowsButton` and `MacOSButton` classes implement the `Button` interface, allowing the factory to create different types of buttons based on the specified operating system.

### Builder Pattern

Definition and purpose: The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It is useful for creating objects with many optional parts or configurations.

Use cases and examples: The Builder Pattern is commonly used in scenarios where an object needs to be constructed with many parameters, such as constructing a complex document or a meal in a restaurant. For example, a builder might be used to create a "meal" object with optional components like a drink, main course, and dessert.

Here is an example of implementing the Builder Pattern in PHP for creating a "meal" object with optional components:

```php
<?php

// Define a Meal class
class Meal
{
    private $components = [];

    public function addComponent($component)
    {
        $this->components[] = $component;
    }

    public function showMeal()
    {
        return "Meal includes: " . implode(", ", $this->components);
    }
}

// Define a MealBuilder class
class MealBuilder
{
    private $meal;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->meal = new Meal();
    }

    public function addDrink($drink)
    {
        $this->meal->addComponent($drink);
        return $this;
    }

    public function addMainCourse($mainCourse)
    {
        $this->meal->addComponent($mainCourse);
        return $this;
    }

    public function addDessert($dessert)
    {
        $this->meal->addComponent($dessert);
        return $this;
    }

    public function getMeal()
    {
        return $this->meal;
    }
}

// Usage
$mealBuilder = new MealBuilder();
$meal = $mealBuilder->addDrink("Coke")
                    ->addMainCourse("Burger")
                    ->addDessert("Ice Cream")
                    ->getMeal();

echo $meal->showMeal(); // Outputs: Meal includes: Coke, Burger, Ice Cream
```

In this example, the `MealBuilder` class provides methods to add different components to a `Meal` object, such as a drink, main course, and dessert. The builder pattern allows for the flexible construction of a `Meal` object with various optional components, demonstrating how the same construction process can create different meal configurations.

## Structural Design Patterns

### Adapter Pattern

Definition and purpose: The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern is useful when you want to use an existing class but its interface does not match the one you need.

Use cases and examples: A common use case is integrating a new component into an existing system where the interfaces do not match. For example, if you have a legacy system that outputs data in a specific format and a new system that requires a different format, an adapter can be used to convert the data format from the legacy system to the new system.

Here is an example of implementing the Adapter Pattern in PHP to integrate a legacy system with a new system that requires a different data format:

```php
<?php

// Legacy system class with an incompatible interface
class LegacySystem
{
    public function getData()
    {
        return "Legacy data format";
    }
}

// New system interface
interface NewSystemInterface
{
    public function getFormattedData();
}

// Adapter class to bridge the legacy system with the new system
class Adapter implements NewSystemInterface
{
    private $legacySystem;

    public function __construct(LegacySystem $legacySystem)
    {
        $this->legacySystem = $legacySystem;
    }

    public function getFormattedData()
    {
        // Convert the legacy data format to the new format
        $legacyData = $this->legacySystem->getData();
        return "Converted: " . $legacyData;
    }
}

// Usage
$legacySystem = new LegacySystem();
$adapter = new Adapter($legacySystem);
echo $adapter->getFormattedData(); // Outputs: Converted: Legacy data format
```

In this example, the `Adapter` class implements the `NewSystemInterface` and acts as a bridge between the `LegacySystem` and the new system. The adapter converts the data from the legacy format to the format expected by the new system, allowing them to work together despite their incompatible interfaces.

### Decorator Pattern

Definition and purpose: The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Use cases and examples: This pattern is often used in graphical user interface toolkits to add responsibilities to objects, such as adding scrollbars to a window. Another example is in stream processing, where decorators can be used to add functionality like buffering, filtering, or compression to a stream.

Here is an example of implementing the Decorator Pattern in PHP to add functionality to a data stream:

```php
<?php

// Define a basic interface for a data stream
interface DataStream
{
    public function read();
}

// Implement a basic FileStream class
class FileStream implements DataStream
{
    public function read()
    {
        return "Reading data from a file.";
    }
}

// Create an abstract Decorator class implementing
```

## Behavioral Design Patterns

### Observer Pattern

Definition and purpose: The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems.

Use cases and examples: Common use cases include implementing event listeners in GUI components, where a change in one component needs to be reflected in others. For example, a news agency might use the observer pattern to notify subscribers about breaking news updates.

Here is an example of implementing the Observer Pattern in PHP to notify subscribers about breaking news updates:

```php
<?php

// Define the Observer interface
interface Observer
{
    public function update($news);
}

// Define the Subject interface
interface Subject
{
    public function attach(Observer $observer);
    public function detach(Observer $observer);
    public function notify();
}

// Implement a NewsAgency class as the Subject
class NewsAgency implements Subject
{
    private $observers = [];
    private $latestNews;

    public function attach(Observer $observer)
    {
        $this->observers[] = $observer;
    }

    public function detach(Observer $observer)
    {
        $this->observers = array_filter($this->observers, function ($obs) use ($observer) {
            return $obs !== $observer;
        });
    }

    public function setLatestNews($news)
    {
        $this->latestNews = $news;
        $this->notify();
    }

    public function notify()
    {
        foreach ($this->observers as $observer) {
            $observer->update($this->latestNews);
        }
    }
}

// Implement a NewsSubscriber class as the Observer
class NewsSubscriber implements Observer
{
    private $name;

    public function __construct($name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function update($news)
    {
        echo $this->name . " received news update: " . $news . PHP_EOL;
    }
}

// Usage
$newsAgency = new NewsAgency();

$subscriber1 = new NewsSubscriber("Subscriber 1");
$subscriber2 = new NewsSubscriber("Subscriber 2");

$newsAgency->attach($subscriber1);
$newsAgency->attach($subscriber2);

$newsAgency->setLatestNews("Breaking News: New Observer Pattern Implemented!");

// Outputs:
// Subscriber 1 received news update: Breaking News: New Observer Pattern Implemented!
// Subscriber 2 received news update: Breaking News: New Observer Pattern Implemented!
```

In this example, the `NewsAgency` class acts as the subject that maintains a list of observers (subscribers). When the news is updated, the `notify` method is called to update all attached observers. The `NewsSubscriber` class implements the `Observer` interface and defines how it should react to updates from the subject. This pattern allows for a flexible and scalable way to handle changes in state across multiple dependent objects.

### Strategy Pattern

Definition and purpose: The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. It is useful for selecting an algorithm at runtime.

Use cases and examples: This pattern is often used in scenarios where multiple algorithms can be applied to a problem, such as sorting algorithms. For example, a payment processing system might use the strategy pattern to select different payment methods like credit card, PayPal, or cryptocurrency.

Here is an example of implementing the Strategy Pattern in PHP for a payment processing system that selects different payment methods:

```php
<?php

// Define the PaymentStrategy interface
interface PaymentStrategy
{
    public function pay($amount);
}

// Implement a CreditCardPayment class
class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy
{
    public function pay($amount)
    {
        return "Paid $" . $amount . " using Credit Card.";
    }
}

// Implement a PayPalPayment class
class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy
{
    public function pay($amount)
    {
        return "Paid $" . $amount . " using PayPal.";
    }
}

// Implement a CryptoPayment class
class CryptoPayment implements PaymentStrategy
{
    public function pay($amount)
    {
        return "Paid $" . $amount . " using Cryptocurrency.";
    }
}

// Define the PaymentContext class
class PaymentContext
{
    private $paymentStrategy;

    public function __construct(PaymentStrategy $paymentStrategy)
    {
        $this->paymentStrategy = $paymentStrategy;
    }

    public function executePayment($amount)
    {
        return $this->paymentStrategy->pay($amount);
    }
}

// Usage
$creditCardPayment = new PaymentContext(new CreditCardPayment());
echo $creditCardPayment->executePayment(100); // Outputs: Paid $100 using Credit Card.

$payPalPayment = new PaymentContext(new PayPalPayment());
echo $payPalPayment->executePayment(200); // Outputs
```

### Command Pattern

Definition and purpose: The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations. This pattern is useful for decoupling the sender and receiver of a request.

Use cases and examples: Common use cases include implementing undo functionality in applications, where each command represents an action that can be reversed. For example, a text editor might use the command pattern to implement actions like typing, deleting, and formatting text, allowing these actions to be undone or redone.

Here is an example of implementing the Command Pattern in PHP for a text editor that supports undo and redo functionality:

```php
<?php

// Define the Command interface
interface Command
{
    public function execute();
    public function undo();
}

// Implement a TextEditor class
class TextEditor
{
    private $text = "";

    public function write($words)
    {
        $this->text .= $words;
    }

    public function erase($length)
    {
        $this->text = substr($this->text, 0, -$length);
    }

    public function getText()
    {
        return $this->text;
    }
}

// Implement a WriteCommand class
class WriteCommand implements Command
{
    private $editor;
    private $words;

    public function __construct(TextEditor $editor, $words)
    {
        $this->editor = $editor;
        $this->words = $words;
    }

    public function execute()
    {
        $this->editor->write($this->words);
    }

    public function undo()
    {
        $this->editor->erase(strlen($this->words));
    }
}

// Implement an Invoker class
class TextEditorInvoker
{
    private $history = [];

    public function executeCommand(Command $command)
    {
        $command->execute();
        $this->history[] = $command;
    }

    public function undo()
    {
        if (!empty($this->history)) {
            $command = array_pop($this->history);
            $command->undo();
        }
    }
}

// Usage
$editor = new TextEditor();
$invoker = new TextEditorInvoker();

$writeCommand1 = new WriteCommand($editor, "Hello ");
$writeCommand2 = new WriteCommand($editor, "World!");

$invoker->executeCommand($writeCommand1);
$invoker->executeCommand($writeCommand2);

echo $editor->getText(); // Outputs: Hello World!

$invoker->undo();
echo $editor->getText(); // Outputs: Hello 

$invoker->undo();
echo $editor->getText(); // Outputs:
```

In this example, the `Command` interface defines the `execute` and `undo` methods. The `WriteCommand` class implements these methods to perform and reverse text writing actions. The `TextEditorInvoker` class manages command execution and undo operations, maintaining a history of executed commands. This pattern allows for flexible and reversible command execution in applications like text editors.
